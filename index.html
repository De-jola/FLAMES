          <p>
            Or three. Or a celebrity that doesn't know you exist. Or your
            barista who spelled your name wrong but smiled anyway.

          <h3>The Solution</h3>

          <p>
            FLAMES is here to turn that overthinking into entertainment. Because
            why stress when you can let math decide?

          <h2>What Even is FLAMES?</h2>

          <p>
            Born in schoolyards across the world, FLAMES is the original
            relationship calculator. Before dating apps, before "sliding into
            DMs," there was just you, your crush's name, and a piece of paper.
          </p>
          <p>
            The rules are simple: write both names, cancel out the common
            letters, count what's left, and let the alphabet gods decide your
            fate. Are you Friends? Lovers? Married? Or (heaven forbid) Enemies?

          Your romantic fate boils down to one of these. No pressure, but this
          definitely determines your entire future.

            <p>
              Maybe you're better off as friends. Or maybe you're just in
              denial. Either way, the friend zone is real and you might be
              living in it.

              This is it. The rom-com writes itself. Cue the rain scene, the
              airport chase, the "I've loved you all along" confession. You're
              living the dream.
