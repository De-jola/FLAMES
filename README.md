## Case Study Summary

**Problem Statement:**  
Almost 8 in 10 people have experienced a crush — whether a celebrity, classmate, or someone spotted randomly on the way to buy bread and akara in your “no one would see me” outfit. The rush of attraction can be exciting, but the anxiety of not knowing where you and your crush stand can also “crush” you. Some people love the thrill of a crush without taking things further; they just want a way to fuel their imagination.

**FLAMES** is a fun, digital outlet for that curiosity. By bringing back the classic schoolyard game, it provides a lighthearted way to "calculate" your fate, squash overthinking, and turn nervous energy into a playful moment.

**Target Audience:**

- High school and university students
- Anyone “young at heart” who enjoys playful romantic curiosity
- Those who aren’t “too mature” to have fun with their crush

**Core Features:**

- Name-matching algorithm removes common letters between you and your crush
- Remaining count determines your destiny in one of six legendary states:

| Letter | State              | Description                 |
| ------ | ------------------ | --------------------------- |
| F      | Friends            | Bestie Energy               |
| L      | Lovers             | Main Character Moment       |
| A      | Admirers           | Watching From Afar          |
| M      | Married            | Wedding Pinterest Activated |
| E      | Enemies            | Block and Move On           |
| S      | Sexual Partners 🙈 | Say Less                    |
